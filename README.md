# 🧠 Assessing the Impact of Product Specifications and Brand Origin on the Pricing of Mechanical Keyboards in 2025

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates how technical specifications and brand origin influence the pricing of mechanical keyboards in 2025. It serves as a case study of broader market forces affecting consumer electronics amid evolving global supply chains, rising manufacturing competition, and changing consumer preferences.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Global supply chains have undergone significant political and economic disruption in recent years, particularly in the technology and consumer electronics sectors.

Mechanical keyboards—once niche and brand-driven—have become a focal point of innovation and pricing disruption. Direct-to-consumer sales, ODM/OEM manufacturing, and transparent specifications challenge legacy pricing norms.

This project explores whether brand prestige and design heritage still hold weight, or whether objective product specifications are now the primary drivers of market value.
